## Coconut Delivery solution

Calculate the lowest-cost method for a "bird" to carry a "coconut" potentially via a set of jetstreams.

## Usage

    $ python3 coconut.py [paths.txt]

## Input

paths.txt is a text file where the first line is the cost of flying in open air, and each subsequent line is a space-separated triple of the start position, end position, and cost of each jetstream.

## Output

The program prints one line with the final cost of flying a path, and a second line with a string representing a list of paths that the bird flies.
